          For decades, a duopoly has controlled the educational hardware market. They have stagnated innovation, locked down firmware, and charged exorbitant prices for hardware that costs pennies to manufacture.

          The NeoCalculator project was born from a singular, radical idea: <strong>What if we could build a scientific calculator that outperforms the industry standard, for the price of a few cups of coffee?</strong>

            By leveraging the raw, terrifying power of the ESP32-S3 microcontroller, and writing a custom operating system (NumOS) injected directly into its veins, we achieved pure computational sovereignty.

          We didn't just build a calculator. We built a platform. The Pro-CAS engine fits entirely within 97KB of SRAM, executing symbolic algebra and complex integrals faster than processors that cost 10x more. Every schematic, every line of C++, is open-source.
