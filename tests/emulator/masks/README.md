# Ignore-rect masks — known volatile screenshot regions

This directory holds **ignore-rect mask files** for the NumOS SDL2 emulator visual
tests. A mask lets [`scripts/compare-ppm.py`](../../../scripts/compare-ppm.py)
tolerate *known, justified* non-deterministic pixels (today: the CalculationApp
blinking text cursor) without weakening byte-comparison anywhere else.

Masking is the **narrow exception** to byte-exact comparison — not the rule. It
exists only because the cursor blink is genuinely nondeterministic across separate
launches; it is **not** a way to paper over a rendering bug. The renderer and
cursor code are frozen (see [`docs/math-renderer-acceptance.md`](../../../docs/math-renderer-acceptance.md)),
so the cursor jitter is fixed in the *comparator*, never in `src/`.

## Why this exists (the cursor-blink finding)

`launcher_smoke.ppm` is byte-stable across launches. The two calc screenshots are
**not**: re-launching `calc_1_plus_2` / `calc_fraction_sum` produces images that
differ only inside a tiny band around the input cursor. The blink is an `lv_timer`
that toggles cursor visibility every 500 ms and the deterministic tick pins the
phase *within* a run, so same-session runs match but spaced-apart launches differ.
Every observed differing pixel falls inside `x[10..34] y[8..16]` (≈ a 25×9 px band);
zero pixels differ outside it. The committed masks below cover that band with a
small safety margin.

## Naming

| Role | Location | Committed? |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Replay script | `tests/emulator/scripts/<stem>.numos` | yes |
| Accepted golden | `tests/emulator/golden/<stem>.ppm` | yes |
| **Ignore-rect mask** | `tests/emulator/masks/<stem>.mask` | **yes** |
| Candidate (machine-generated) | `out/emulator-candidates/<stem>.ppm` | no (`out/` git-ignored) |

The stem matches the script / golden exactly, so CI can auto-discover a mask:
golden `calc_1_plus_2.ppm` ↔ mask `calc_1_plus_2.mask`. **A mask is optional per
golden.** A golden with no `.mask` is compared byte-for-byte — absence of a mask
never silently weakens a gate. Do **not** add a mask for a byte-stable screenshot
(e.g. `launcher_smoke`).

## File format

Plain text, one ignore-rect per line:

```
# comment lines start with '#'; blank lines are ignored
x,y,w,h        # top-left origin, pixels; trailing comment allowed
```

Rules enforced by `compare-ppm.py`:

- `x,y` must be `>= 0` and `w,h` must be `> 0`, else the comparison errors (exit 2).
- A rect extending past the 320×240 frame is **clipped** to the frame; an off-image
  origin simply ignores nothing.
- Pixels inside any rect are excluded from the mismatch count, the bounding box,
  and the equality decision. In a `--write-diff` image they render flat **teal**.

## Authoring rules (load-bearing)

1. **No tool ever writes here.** Masks enter the tree only through a deliberate
   human `git commit`, alongside the golden they cover. `compare-ppm.py` only
   *reads* masks; `generate-emulator-candidates.py` only writes `out/`.
2. **Keep masks tight.** Cover only the proven-volatile region. Over-masking hides
   real regressions — never mask the expression or result pixels (the `3`, the `5/6`).
3. **Justify every mask.** Each rect needs a comment saying *why* it exists, and
   the mask should be backed by a reproduced jitter diff (regenerate the same
   candidate twice and `compare-ppm.py A B --write-diff jitter.ppm`; the magenta
   region is the minimum the mask must cover).

## Reviewer checklist (so a bad image is not blessed)

- Confirm the candidate is **semantically correct** *before* masking (a human still
  asserts "1+2 really renders 3" — masking the cursor does not relax this).
- Confirm the masked region is genuinely nondeterministic, not a bug being hidden.
- Confirm the mask does not cover the expression/result area.
- Reject any mask covering a large fraction of the frame.
